The form ``admin_search_people.html``, in the context of the
site, allows the site administrator to search for a site
member. If found the administrator is redirected to the
profile-page for that person, otherwise an error is shown.

.. note:: The page is restricted to site members for privacy
          reasons.

The viewlet ``gs-search-people-link`` provides a link from the
site-administration links [#links]_ to the *Search for people*
page.
